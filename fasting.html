            <p>
                Fasting is practiced by many cultures and religions for many different purposes. The most common purposes are to cleanse the body and as a method of worship. Fasting involves eating nothing for a long period of time. Some religions have specified days for fasting on holidays or festivals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Judaism has two full fast days, one on Yom Kippur and the other on Tisha B'Av. For Judaism, a full fast means eating and drinking nothing, including water, from sunset the day before to sunset on the following day.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Muslims, their period of fasting is on the month of Ramadan. For a month, they are not allowed to eat from sunrise to sunset.
            </p>
            <p>
                For Hindus, like their diets, fasting patterns also vary. They may fast on certain days of the week in order to appease certain deities based on their beliefs. There are also festivals such as the nine-night celebration Navarātrī and the month of Śravaṇa on which Hindus may fast. What they eat also varies; some eat nothing while others eat only pure foods, such as yogurt and fruit.
