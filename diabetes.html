            <h1>Diabetes</h1>
            <h2>Diet:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Very dependent on their blood sugar level (if too high need insulin, and too low need sugar)</li>
                <li>Usually it is unsafe to consume a lot of sugar in a short amount of time</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>About:</h2>
            <p>Insulin is a hormone that regulates the blood stream by taking out glucose to transport to cells
                around the body. Someone with diabetes is unable to regulate their blood sugar level, either
                because their pancreas cannot produce enough insulin or their body is immune to the insulin they produce. 
            </p>
            <p>There are two types of diabetes that exist. Type I diabetes is genetic and there is no cure. Type
                I diabetics are unable to produce insulin or they are immune to the insulin they produce. On the
                other hand, type II diabetics can still make insulin, but they form an insulin resistance which
                can eventually lead to being unable to secrete insulin at all. Type II diabetes is usually caused
                by unhealthy eating habits and sugar intake.
            </p>
            <p>For both types, if their blood sugar levels get too high it results in ketoacidosis, where there are
                too many blood acids and not enough insulin to break it down. If left untreated, they can fall into
                a coma or possibly die. Diabetics will usually carry with them some sort of blood sugar meter they
                use to measure their glucose levels and a method of getting insulin, such as injection or pump.
            </p>
